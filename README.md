# PABAKE
This is the repository containing the files for the PABAKE Ontology. An ontology developed to create a Knowledge Base over data taken from:

• RON - Rete Ondametrica Nazionale: http://semantics.istc.cnr.it/ispra/data/ron.zip
• RMN – Rete Mareografica Nazionale: http://semantics.istc.cnr.it/ispra/data/rmn.zip
• RON and RMN observations: http://semantics.istc.cnr.it/ispra/data/obs.zip

The Docker includes all the entities as well as services for visualizing and exploring the ontology:
• LODE: for knowledge graph browsing
• LODView: for human-readable documentation of the ontology
• Virtuoso: expose a SPARQL Endpoint to query the knowledge graph
